# QR Handoff - Send URLs from one device to another

![QR How-to](https://github.com/PositiveControl/qr_handoff/blob/master/images/handoff-usage.png)

## About QR Handoff
If you use all Apple devices and Safari, you can easily handoff websites from one device to the next.  But throw a Windows box or and Android phone into the mix and you're out of luck.  Until now!  With the QR Handoff Chrome/Brave extension, a temporary and unique QR code is generated for every URL you visit, allowing you to scan the QR code on any capable device, then continue surfing where you left off.  

QR Handoff does not store URLs or generated QR codes.

## How to use QR Handoff
1. Click the extension to generate a QR code that contains the current tab's URL
2. Scan the QR code with a capable device
3. Open the URL on your device's browser
